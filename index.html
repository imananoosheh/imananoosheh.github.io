        <p class="bio">
          It was almost 3 years ago, about the end of 2015 when I understood my strongest motivation in life is
          creation. Even the slightest possibility of me being a creator makes me put all my affords into creating
          something brand new, from scratch. All these sweatings give me a unique feeling of parenthood over what is
          created.</p>
        <p class="bio">first time I felt this, was at a C++ programming class; It was like an epiphany which said I can
          create anything I want!; even then I knew when It comes to practical work there will be challenges to face but
          I also knew the only limitation is my imagination.I'm highly interested in Machine Learning and Artificial
          Intelligence because not only they can be created but also they have the ability to grow which amplifies my
          sense of parenthood and gives me tremendous amount of satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="bio">And I always had those organizing and
          analyzing characteristics; I always want to analyze behaviors and any kind of chain reaction to find
          correlations; I think this helped me to debug my programs, technologies I work with, my surroundings and even
          my life to some extent.</p>
        <p class="bio">I have been a local and a national vice-president in AIESEC organization in Iran. I
          have traveled to different
          countries around the globe during 3 years of my work experience, which gave me the opportunity to delegate in
          different conferences and seminars whereas being an Agenda Manager, Facilitator, Conference Manager and
          Organizing Committee President in most of them. These 3 years of experience empowered my soft skills such as
          teamwork, communication skills, problem-solving, organizational skills and crisis management.</p>
        <p class="bio">As I got more
          interested in the field of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Machine Learning, I took
          difference coursed and self-studied the fields and practiced to solve more problem which helped me to learn
          and pushed me to gain practical skills to work with proper tools such as R language, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib,
          Scipy, Pandas and etc. I always find myself more effective and learning more when it comes to practical
          projects, which is reflected in my labs’ grades.</p>
        <p class="bio">Since 2015, I practiced my web development skills such as
          HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap,
          Vue.js, Django, Jinja, Wordpress and etc in different projects.
