Sure! Here's an example of an Apache Airflow DAG with a complex hierarchy where each task simply echoes the message indicating the current step:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator

# Define the DAG
default_args = {
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 7, 10),
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)
}

dag = DAG(
    'complex_hierarchy_dag',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval=None
)

# Define the tasks
with dag:
    task_1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_1',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 1"',
    )

    task_2 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_2',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 2"',
    )

    task_3 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_3',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 3"',
    )

    task_4 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_4',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 4"',
    )

    task_5 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_5',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 5"',
    )

    task_6 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_6',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 6"',
    )

    task_7 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_7',
        bash_command='echo "Executing Task 7"',
    )

    task_1 >> [task_2, task_3]
    task_2 >> task_4
    task_3 >> task_4
    task_4 >> task_5
    task_4 >> task_6
    task_5 >> task_7
    task_6 >> task_7
```

In this example, we have a DAG named `'complex_hierarchy_dag'` with seven tasks (`task_1` to `task_7`). Each task uses the `BashOperator` to echo the message indicating the current step.

The task dependencies create a complex hierarchy where `task_1` is the starting point, followed by `task_2` and `task_3`, which are both dependencies for `task_4`. `task_4` has two subsequent tasks, `task_5` and `task_6`, and both of them depend on `task_4`. Finally, `task_7` depends on both `task_5` and `task_6`.

Note that the `bash_command` in each task is simply an echo statement to indicate the execution of that particular task. You can modify the `bash_command` to perform other actions as needed.

Remember to save this DAG file in the appropriate location recognized by your Airflow installation.
